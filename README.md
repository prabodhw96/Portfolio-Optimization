# Optimal Asset Allocation using Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio Efficient Frontier
## Overview
The Sharpe Ratio (SR) is a measure of risk-adjusted return. It describes how much excess return you receive for the volatility of holding a riskier asset. The estimated SR always follows a normal distribution even if the returns do not. The probabilistic sharpe ratio gives us the confidence level associated with a particular SR estimation.
